# BonusDatesBetween

This is a simple Java program that finds palindrome dates within a specified date range.

## Overview

Palindrome dates are dates that can be read the same way forwards and backwards.

This program allows you to input a date range, and it will identify and display palindrome dates within that range.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Java source file `Main.java` in your preferred Java development environment.

3. Run the `main` method in `Main.java`.

4. The program will prompt you to enter a starting year and an ending year. It will then calculate and display palindrome dates within that date range.

## Example

Suppose you enter a date range of 2000 to 2025. The program will find and display palindrome dates within that range, such as "2001-10-02" and "2010-01-02."
